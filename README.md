## Problem-Domain
A ride-sharing company (Company X) is interested in predicting rider retention. To explore this question, we will explore a sample dataset of a cohort of
users who signed up for an account in January 2014. The data was pulled on July
1, 2014; we consider a user retained if they were “active” (i.e. took a trip)
in the preceding 30 days (from the day the data was pulled).
