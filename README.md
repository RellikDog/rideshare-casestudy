## Problem-Domain
A ride-sharing company (Company X) is interested in predicting rider retention. To explore this question, we will explore a sample dataset of a cohort of
users who signed up for an account in January 2014. The data was pulled on July
1, 2014; we consider a user retained if they were “active” (i.e. took a trip)
in the preceding 30 days (from the day the data was pulled).

## Lessons Learned
-When we first got out data cleaned and out models working we tried to run a random forest and a linear regression.  We noticed that our random forest did better at percision but the linear regression had better recall.

-if we assumed all users churned we would start with an accuracy of 62%
