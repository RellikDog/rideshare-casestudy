## Problem-Domain
A ride-sharing company (Company X) is interested in predicting rider retention. To explore this question, we will explore a sample dataset of a cohort of
users who signed up for an account in January 2014. The data was pulled on July
1, 2014; we consider a user retained if they were “active” (i.e. took a trip)
in the preceding 30 days (from the day the data was pulled).

## Lessons Learned
-When we first got out data cleaned and out models working we tried to run a random forest and a linear regression.  We noticed that our random forest did better at percision but the linear regression had better recall.

-if we assumed all users churned we would start with an accuracy of 62%

## Presentation

How did you compute the target?

What model did you use in the end? Why?

Alternative models you considered? Why are they not good enough?

What performance metric did you use to evaluate the model? Why?

Based on insights from the model, what plans do you propose to reduce churn?

What are the potential impacts of implementing these plans or decisions? What performance metrics did you use to evaluate these decisions, why?
